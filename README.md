## 📊 Feasibility Analysis

### 1. Technical Feasibility

| Criteria       | Analysis |
|----------------|----------|
| **Platform**   | iOS supports database apps using Swift/SwiftUI. PostgreSQL can be accessed via native clients or custom APIs. |
| **Connectivity** | PostgreSQL allows secure TCP/IP remote connections. iOS can use libraries like `PostgresClientKit`. |
| **Security**   | Requires SSL/TLS, SSH tunneling, and secure credential storage (Keychain). |
| **Functionality** | Core DBeaver features like SQL querying, browsing schemas, and editing are achievable. Advanced GUI (e.g., ERD design) may be limited. |
| ✅ Conclusion   | **Feasible** with technical trade-offs for mobile UX.

---

### 2. Operational Feasibility

| Criteria         | Analysis |
|------------------|----------|
| **User Base**    | DBAs, developers, data engineers, system administrators. |
| **Usage Context** | Mobile diagnostics, production database monitoring, lightweight querying. |
| **UX Constraints** | Requires touch-optimized UI and adaptive layout for small screens. |
| ✅ Conclusion     | **Feasible** with attention to mobile-first design.

---

### 3. Financial Feasibility

| Criteria       | Analysis |
|----------------|----------|
| **Development Cost** | $30,000–$100,000 depending on scope and team. |
| **Revenue Models** | Freemium, subscriptions, or in-app purchases. |
| **ROI Potential** | Moderate to high for niche developer tools. |
| ✅ Conclusion     | **Feasible**, especially with recurring revenue.

---

### 4. Market Feasibility

| Criteria       | Analysis |
|----------------|----------|
| **Competition** | Few mobile-focused PostgreSQL clients. Opportunity to lead the space. |
| **Market Gap**  | No full-featured iOS DBeaver-like app currently dominates the market. |
| ✅ Conclusion     | **Feasible**, with clear differentiation.

---

### 5. Challenges and Limitations

| Challenge | Description | Potential Solution |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| Network Access | Requires safe and secure PostgreSQL access remotely. | TLS/SSL, SSH tunnels, safe credential storage. |
| UI Complexity | Hard to design full DB tools on mobile screen. | Use tabs, collapsible views, smart input editors. |
| Schema Browsing | ER diagrams are hard on phones. | Simplify with tree views and list-based schema browsing. |
| Offline Limitations | DB access needs live connection. | Enable offline query drafts for later use. |

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

| Dimension    | Verdict |
|--------------|---------|
| Technical     | ✅ Yes |
| Operational   | ✅ Yes |
| Financial     | ✅ Yes |
| Market        | ✅ Yes |

**Conclusion:** Building a PostgreSQL mobile client for iOS (like DBeaver) is **highly feasible** with an MVP focused on essential features. Potential exists for long-term monetization and niche adoption.
